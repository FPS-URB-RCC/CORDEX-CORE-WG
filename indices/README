* Code to compute 1D indices from 3-rank data combining python and Fortran
Python is not that good when looping, Fortran does.

Thus, this suite combines both languages. Python will acces the data, and the computation of 1D index over the space for multiple grid points (implygin loops) will be done by Fortran

= Compilation =
Compilation is done via a Makfile

* Reqisits
  - Fortran compiler
  - python 3.*
  - f2py
